# Golden Framework V1 - Not Maintained

This is V1 of the Golden Framework. I stopped developing this framework due to me having no time to maintain the resource.

So I am deciding to make it public, for anyone to use.

This is NOT 100% complete, There is still a lot to be done on the framework. (Exports, etc...)

Currently, This Framework is only setup for the basic **LSPD, BCSO, SAHP, LSFD** departments. I was going to work on a more automatic system for departments but never got around to doing that. So for now, the departments are hard coded (the paychecks can be changed in the config).
